# AI-python-chess

With this code you can play chess against an "artificial intelligence"

You're the white player

## Install requirements

```py
pip install chess
```

## Usage

```shell
py game.py
```

## Play

Click the place you want to move from, then click the place you want to move to, then press sent.

If you have pressed anything else don't worry, this program is pretty smart, just repeat the former step, the program will choose your last step.

If you press sent and the step you did is invalid the same board will be load again.

The computer is kinda slow at first but don't worry it will be faster...

## More information

the specific numbers in the program have been taken from the [incredible article](http://doras.dcu.ie/17193/1/aidan_haran_20120704093656.pdf) by [Aidan Haran](https://github.com/aidanharan) where he has already tested the numbers I would specify and 'did the work for me' I chose what he called "Aggressive Personality" (page 71) because it has 27 points, while the other configurations have: -135, 11, -72 and -12 (page 83)
